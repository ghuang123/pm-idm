## Milestones & Progress

Our milestones are continuously updated and detailed in the [IDM Workplan Document](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Venqgkcao2Lcje0mkCxr9u0H037aC3H5IxMfsoaeMoE). You can also see them in the [Milestiones section](https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/pm-idm/milestones) of this repository.

On the first monday of every sprint we have a remote call, at 4:00 PM GMT, to report the project's current progress.
We create an issue with the label [`progress-call`](https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/pm-idm/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+label%3Aprogress-call) for each scheduled call, containing a link to the agenda & notes and with instructions on how to join the video call. Moreover, all previous meetings' notes may be found in the [meetings](meetings) folder.

## Contributing

All work is organised on GitHub throughout this repository. There is also a [Project Board](https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/pm-idm/projects/1) that we use for organisation, prioritisation and sprint planning.

To manage our project, we adopted the Scrum methodology with two-week sprints.
Every sprint begins on a monday with the sprint planning meeting. Additionally, on the second monday of each sprint, there is a backlog grooming session. At the end of each sprint, we do a sprint review and a sprint retrospective to analyse what can be improved and what we commit to do better in the next one.

The best way to contribute would be to open a [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/pm-idm/issues) and, if you are willing to, open a [Pull Request](https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/pm-idm/pulls) while targeting the respective issue. Also please take in consideration that every commit should be following [Conventional Commits](https://conventionalcommits.org/) guidelines.

You may reach us on [IRC at #ipfs-identity on freenode](https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=%23ipfs-identity). Also, you are welcome to join us in our sprint progress report call, as detailed in [Milestones & Progress](#milestones--progress).
